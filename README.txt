Hello peeps!

This is a repos where I collect all the algorithmic trading strategies that I have created based on some youtube tutorials where each jupyter notebooks (specifically Google Colab notebooks) are included with comments on each lines of code as well as the link to the Youtube 
video itself.

It is a learning process, so feel free to add comments on any lines of code that you feel like it can be improved or fix!

DISCLAIMER : ALL models uploaded here are only created for educational purposes and SHOULD NOT be used as financial/trading advice.
